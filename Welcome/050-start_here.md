## Instructions

Welcome to AUCTF 2020! This is our first time throwing a public CTF so we hope you enjoy it. For those who are interested in providing feedback we will be releasing a survey challenge halfway through the CTF so keep your eyes peeled!

A reminder for those Auburn students who are interesting in competiting for prizes you must be in a team of one!

Our flag format is auctf{.....}

Try putting in auctf{on_the_house} for this challenge.

Thanks, AUCTF team
